Hello World

This site is a living notebook.

It exists as a place to collect, organize, and expand on my thoughts, notes, and questions across the many subjects that interest me. Some entries are polished, others are works in progress—but all of them reflect genuine curiosity and an ongoing process of learning.

My goal is twofold:

- to create a public record of what I’m studying and thinking about, and
- to make that record useful to anyone who happens to stumble across it.

If something here helps clarify an idea, sparks curiosity, or encourages deeper engagement with a topic, then the site is doing its job.

During college, I never fully experienced learning the way I wanted to.

At the time, I was working full-time, raising two young kids, and juggling the constant pressure of deadlines. Homework wasn’t an opportunity to explore ideas—it was something to survive. The intention behind it was sound: force engagement with the material. But in practice, it often meant rushing from one week to the next, doing what was necessary to get by.

Now, with more perspective and (thankfully) more breathing room, I want to return to that material.

I plan to revisit old textbooks, digitize notes, work through problems properly, and take the time to understand concepts at a deeper level—this time for the enjoyment of learning itself, not just the grade.
