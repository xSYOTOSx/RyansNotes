Hello World

My goal with this site is to make a digial notebook as it were. I want to compile notes and throughts on the various aspects of my intrests in a detailed and public view. I also want it to reflect on my learning of various subjects that intrest me and to be an aid to those who stubble upon my site. 

I want to go though my old college textboooks and digitize some notes and work on some problemes. One thing i never got to fully enjoy in college was working on homework. The intent of homework was to force the student to engage in the material that was covered in class, but at the time i was working full time, and had two small kids that i was rassing and a full time student. So i never got to really embrace the material. It was mostly surving one week to the next trying to accomplish all the tasks that were due. Now id like to go back and really enjoy the material and hopefully help others in the process.
